# Setup Log for AI Image Generator

## Environment
- Python 3.10.6
- Torch 2.1.2+cu121
- Gradio 3.41.2
- xformers: N/A
- WebUI Version: v1.10.1
- Model: AnythingXL_xl.safetensors (Stable Diffusion XL-based)
- GPU: Local system without dedicated training (inference only)

## Notes
- The generator uses pre-trained Stable Diffusion checkpoints.
- Configured and optimized via the Automatic1111 WebUI interface.
- No custom model training was performed.
- Outputs depend on model weights, prompt design, and sampling parameters.
- Used ChatGPT and Gemini for setup guidance, prompt refinement, and workflow troubleshooting.

## Typical Settings Used
- Sampler: DPM++ 2M
- Steps: 35–45
- CFG Scale: 7–8
- Resolution: 512x512 (square gives best results)
- Hires.fix: ON, Upscaler: RealESRGAN x2
- Img2Img Denoise: 0.25

## Observations
- Non-square resolutions tend to blur unless upscaled with Hires.fix.
- Model performs best for stylized or anime-type visuals.
- Prompt clarity directly affects detail sharpness.
- Increasing steps improves detail but also processing time.
